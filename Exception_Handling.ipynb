    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exception occurs, the program execution is immediately halted, and the control is transferred to an exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions in Python are objects that represent errors or exceptional conditions. They are used to handle and manage unexpected or exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Exception Handling: Exception handling is the process of dealing with exceptions that occur during program execution. It allows the program to handle errors gracefully and continue its execution instead of abruptly terminating.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Types of Exceptions: Python provides a variety of built-in exception classes for handling different types of errors or exceptional situations. Some common exception types include TypeError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, IndexError, KeyError, and ZeroDivisionError, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Exception Handling Mechanism: The exception handling mechanism in Python involves the use of the try, except, else, and finally blocks. The try block is used to enclose the code that may raise an exception. The except block is used to catch and handle specific exceptions. The else block is executed if no exceptions occur. The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Raising Exceptions: In addition to handling built-in exceptions, you can also raise your own exceptions using the raise statement. This allows you to create custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios or errors in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors: Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when an error or exceptional condition is encountered. Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur during the parsing or interpretation of the code when there is a violation of the language syntax rules. Syntax errors are typically detected before the program is executed and need to be fixed in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions in Python are used to handle and manage errors or exceptional situations that occur during program execution. They provide a mechanism to gracefully handle errors, recover from exceptional conditions, and ensure the smooth execution of the program"
